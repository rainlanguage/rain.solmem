# rain.solmem

Solidity memory libraries — pointer arithmetic, byte-level copying, and dynamic
arrays/matrices that don't go through Solidity's safety-checked allocator.

## Libraries

| Library            | What it does                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LibPointer`       | Raw memory pointer arithmetic, with explicit `Pointer` user-defined type. |
| `LibMemCpy`        | Word-aligned and byte-aligned `memcpy` between memory pointers.           |
| `LibBytes`         | In-place mutation, slicing, and pointer-level access for `bytes`.         |
| `LibUint256Array`  | Dynamic `uint256[]` operations: extend, copy, dedup-sort, truncate.       |
| `LibBytes32Array`  | Dynamic `bytes32[]` mirror of `LibUint256Array`.                          |
| `LibUint256Matrix` | `uint256[][]` operations.                                                 |
| `LibBytes32Matrix` | `bytes32[][]` operations.                                                 |
| `LibStackSentinel` | Sentinel-terminated stack walks for unknown-length data.                  |

These libraries assume the caller knows what they're doing with memory. Out-of-
bounds access, double-frees, and aliasing are the caller's responsibility.

## Requirements

- **solc.** Every source file declares `pragma solidity ^0.8.25;`.
- **Cancun.** Build with `evm_version = "cancun"` or later, and deploy only to
  chains that have activated cancun. Every copy path compiles to the `mcopy`
  opcode: `LibMemCpy`, `LibUint256Array`/`LibBytes32Array` and
  `LibUint256Matrix`/`LibBytes32Matrix`. A pre-cancun `evm_version` fails at
  compile time. Cancun bytecode on a chain that has not activated cancun reverts
  with `invalid opcode` at runtime, in every copy, extend, flatten and
  `matrixFrom` path.

## Install

Via [soldeer](https://soldeer.xyz) (in your foundry project's root):

```sh
forge soldeer install rain-solmem~<version>
```

Versioned remappings end up in `dependencies/rain-solmem-<version>/`. Add the
remapping to `remappings.txt` or `foundry.toml`.

## Develop

This repo uses [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) for its dev shell. The
default shell is the slim Solidity-only `sol-shell` from
[rainix](https://github.com/rainlanguage/rainix) — no rust, node, or chromium.

```sh
nix develop          # enter the shell
forge soldeer install # install dependencies declared in foundry.toml
forge test
```

Tasks exposed via the shell (delegate to rainix):

- `rainix-sol-test` — `forge test`
- `rainix-sol-static` — slither
- `rainix-sol-legal` — `reuse lint`
- `rainix-sol-artifacts` — `forge build`

Use the nix-pinned `forge` for all development to keep versions consistent.

## Publish

Tag `v<x.y.z>` on `main`. The
[`Publish to Soldeer`](.github/workflows/publish-soldeer.yaml) workflow runs
`forge soldeer push rain-solmem~<x.y.z>` on every `v*` tag. The package name is
derived from the repo name with `.` substituted for `-`.
